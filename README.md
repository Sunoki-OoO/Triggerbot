Sunoki's Triggerbot

v2 in Development ðŸš€

About

Hello, I'm Sunoki. I've been sharing bypasses and tutorials on how to update or create a triggerbot. However, I noticed many people just want one that works out of the box. So, here you go!

I'm currently working on v2, which will include improvements to make it better for legit players.

Features

Config System

When you open the script, it will ask for your settings:

Field of View (FOV)

Keybind

HSV Range (Default is yellow, but customizable)

Shooting Rate

FPS

Config Management

After creating a config, on future runs, the script will ask if you want to load your existing config or update itâ€”no need to redo your settings each time.

How to Use

Step 1: Install Python

Download and install Python (Make sure to add it to your PATH).

Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following script to install the required libraries:

python install_libraries.py

Step 3: Run the Triggerbot

Copy the path to the folder where the Triggerbot (Triggerbot.py) is located.

Open Command Prompt (cmd) and navigate to the directory:

cd path-to-folder

Run the script:

python Triggerbot.py

The script will open and ask for your preferred settings.

Important

Make sure you set your fire key as O.

Upcoming Features in v2

Dynamic signature changing each time the script runs to enhance security.
